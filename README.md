## TASK-1: Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction

### Problem Statement
The goal of this task is to implement a **Linear Regression Model** to predict house prices based on the following features:
- **Square footage**
- **Number of bedrooms**
- **Number of bathrooms**

This project provides a foundation for understanding regression analysis and developing a machine learning model to solve real-world prediction problems.

## Data

### Description
The dataset used in this project contains information on 128 houses, with the following features:
- **Price**: The selling price of the house (target variable).
- **SqFt**: Square footage of the house.
- **Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms.
- **Bathrooms**: Number of bathrooms.
- **Offers**: Number of offers received for the house.
- **Brick**: Whether the house has brick construction (`Yes` or `No`).
- **Neighborhood**: The location of the house (`East`, `North`, or `West`).

### Sample Rows from the Dataset
| Home | Price   | SqFt | Bedrooms | Bathrooms | Offers | Brick | Neighborhood |
|------|---------|------|----------|-----------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 1    | 114300  | 1790 | 2        | 2         | 2      | No    | East         |
| 2    | 114200  | 2030 | 4        | 2         | 3      | No    | East         |
| 3    | 114800  | 1740 | 3        | 2         | 1      | No    | East         |
| 4    | 94700   | 1980 | 3        | 2         | 3      | No    | East         |
| 5    | 119800  | 2130 | 3        | 3         | 3      | No    | East         |
